## Technologies Used
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Getting Started
To play the game, [click here!](https://reidwids.github.io/Battleship/).

## Next Steps
I would like to implement a stronger guessing algorithm for the CPU. Ideally, it could keep track of the leads it gets and in the case where it hits multiple ships, it can keep track of all viable potential guesses. As well as this, I would like to make the game mobile friendly.
