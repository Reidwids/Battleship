## Next Steps
- Implement a stronger guessing algorithm for the CPU. Ideally, it could keep track of the leads it gets and in the case where it hits multiple ships, it can keep track of all viable potential guesses. 

- Make the game mobile friendly.

- Style the ships to actually look like battleships.
